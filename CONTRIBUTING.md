# How to contribute

You are encouraged to submit issues and merge requests. Submit only feature requests that you intend to contribute to. Do not submit feature requests for niche features such as 3rd party integrations that you do not intend to build (or fund).

A good issue includes reproducible steps for bugs. Clear use cases for feature requests.
